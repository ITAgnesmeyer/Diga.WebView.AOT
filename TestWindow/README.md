WebBrowser APP based on [CoreWindowsWrapper](https://github.com/ITAgnesmeyer/CoreWindowsWrapper)

It uses the [Diga.NativeControls.WebBrowser](../Diga.NativeControls.WebBrowser/README.md) Library.

#### Complile:

Do not use Visual Studio Publish!

Use the command line:

```cmd
dotnet publish -f net10.0 -a x64
```

The compiled file is only **4.5 MB** in size!

If you compile with Windows.Forms ths size is about **20 MB** or more!
